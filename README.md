# Obsidian Everforest Theme

An Obsidian port of the [Everforest](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest) theme family. Heavily inspired by [another project of the same name](https://github.com/0xGlitchbyte/obsidian_everforest) with my custom additions.

I had some issues with the styling of the other project but the codebase was very different to what the semantics of the official theme area, so I decided to remake the entire thing froms scratch

## Features

- Improved and custom callouts
- Light and Dark themes

## Installation

1. Download this repo
2. Move Obsidian.css file into your `.obsidian/themes` folder
3. Rename the file to `Everforest.css` so it has a unique name
4. Open **Settings > Appearance** in your vault
5. Select the theme under the Themes dropdown

## TODO

- Add screenshots
