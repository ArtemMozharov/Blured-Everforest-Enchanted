# Obsidian Everforest Theme

An Obsidian port of the [Everforest](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest) theme family. Heavily inspired by [another project of the same name](https://github.com/0xGlitchbyte/obsidian_everforest) with my custom additions.

I had some issues with the styling of the other project but the codebase was very different to what the semantics of the official theme area, so I decided to remake the entire thing froms scratch
